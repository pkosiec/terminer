# Terminer

Upgrade your terminal experience with a single command.

> **WARNING**: This project is in a very early stage.

Terminer is an cross-platform installer for terminal presets. Install Fish or ZSH shell packed with useful plugins and sleek prompts. Use one of starter recipes or make yours.

## Introduction

Command line interface (CLI) is a great way to access various operating system functions. It allows you to automate time-consuming tasks with a single command. Also, not all features are available with graphical user interface (GUI).

The command line interface is available through a program called terminal emulator, which launches shell. Shell is a program which processes user input and returns output.

## Motivation

Usually, default shell setup is bare-bones. Luckily, there is a way to upgrade it: install different shells along with useful plugins. They can introduce features such as autocompletion or syntax highlighting. You can also install prompts, which can display useful pieces of information, like current git branch. All these additions heavily improve user experience and save your time.

There is one downside of the shell experience customization. It's a time-consuming task. Installing different shell is easy, but to configure it well, you can easily spend hours for searching useful plugins, prompts, themes and fonts.

Not anymore. Use Terminer. Bootstrap your complete shell configuration in a moment.
